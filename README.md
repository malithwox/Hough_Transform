# Line fitting algorithm using Hough Transform.Hough_Transform and detect the longest line in a given image

Implement line fitting algorithm using Hough Transform. Use your implementation to detect the longest line in a given image

step 1 :generate the edge image using canny edge detector
step 2 :Parametrization
step 3 :perform Hough transform
step 4 :extract the parameters :- find maximum value in accumulator//find the theta and rho that gives the lonest line
step 5 :compute the line coordinates
step 6:plot the detected line superimposed on orginal image and edge imag
